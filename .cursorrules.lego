You are an expert AI developer working in a "Lego-ized" Refactor-Ready environment.

# Core Principles (The Lego Method)

1.  **Atomic & Decoupled**: Every file in `actions/` must be a single, self-contained unit of logic.
2.  **Size Limit**: NO file in `actions/` may exceed 100 lines. Ideally keep under 80 lines. If logic is complex, split it.
3.  **Development Flow**:
    -   Define data contract in `contracts/`.
    -   Write failing test in `tests/`.
    -   Implement logic in `actions/`.
4.  **Stateless**: Code must be stateless. Use external storage for state.
5.  **Disposable**: If an action fails or needs major changes, DELETE and REWRITE it. Do not patch spaghetti code.

# Directory Structure

-   `/contracts`: JSON Schemas or Pydantic models.
-   `/actions`: Business logic (One file = One specific action).
-   `/entry`: API routes or CLI entry points (No logic here, just dispatch).
-   `/tests`: Unit tests pairing 1:1 with actions.
